# 3d-braille
A system for creating and exporting braille as a 3D-printable object

## Overview
Braille is a system of raised dots—in the past as seen on paper—to represent letters for the blind. Now, with the advent of the 3D printer, I've made it easy to print braille messages.

## Instructions
This is a command line interface (CLI) which accepts some arguments such as the text to be turned into a braille message. The CLI produces a standard STL (mesh) file as an output which is suitable for opening in a slicer program such as Cura. This final process then will create a GCODE file for your printer.
